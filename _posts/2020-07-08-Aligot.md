Aligot is a papar pubulished in 2012 and it has made a significant progress on cryptographic function identification. Here is the [Aligo paper](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00762924/document). 

In this blog, I am going to share the notes i took when reading the paper. 

### Introduction

The importance of analyzing and identifying the use of crypto functions: 

1. get to know the intentions of those creating and deploying the malware.
2. help identify the tool/method/people behind particular malware attacks.
3. static unpackers — extract core logic or packed programs without executing them — write signatures on malware core features.

Problem: most existing tools are ineffective on obfuscated programs

Hence simple static-analysis identification of cryptographic functions is not suitable for such programs.

Solution: Proposed a tool called Aligot for identifying crypto functions and retrieving their parameters, in a manner that is essentially independent of the actual implementation. This tool more focuses on the input-output relationship of crypto functions and it mainly focuses on the problem of identifying cryptographic functions along a  given execution path.

The method consists of (1) the retrieval of I/O parameters of possible crypto code during its execution, (2) the comparison of the observed I/P relationship with those of known ones.

### Related Work:

( dynamic analysis: Neo Lutz

indicators to recognize crypto code (1) presence of loops (2) a high ratio of bitwise arithmetic instructions (3) entropy change in the data.)

 Most of the previous work cannot handle obfuscated programs.

### Solution

Steps for identifying crypto functions in obfuscated programs:

1. *Gather execution trace of the targeted program. [dynamic analysis]*

    Collect **dynamic instruction D** at each step during execution which is a tuple composed of 

    memory address A[D]

    machine instruction I[D] executed at A[D]

    memory address read and written RA[D] and WA[D] by I[D]

    An execution trace T is a finite sequence D1; . . . ; Dn of dynamic instructions.

2. *Extract cryptographic code with I/O parameters from execution traces. [loop data flow]*

    **Simple loop definition:** a simple loop instance is defined by at least two repetitions of a machine instruction sequence, called its body

    **Nested Loop Definition:** we replace each instance of a same loop with the same identifier so that nested loop won't be ignored.

    **Loop Instance Detection Algorithm:**  The LOOP recognition algorithm processes machine instructions from the execution trace one after the other, and stores them at the end of a list-like structure, named history.

    **Loop Input-output parameters**

    Loop instance parameters are low-level counterparts of high-level implementation parameters

    **LOOP DATA FLOW**

    We define the data flow between loop instances in a similar way to def-use chains [3]: two loop instances L1 and L2 are connected if L1 produces an output parameter used by L2 as an input parameter. For the sake of simplicity, we con- sider only memory parameters, because register parameters would require a precise taint tracking inside sequential code between loop instances.

3. Comparison with known cryptographic functions.

    **Comparison Algorithm**

    1. Generation of all possible I/O values
    2. Input parameter mapping

        the algorithm selects for each high-level parameter its possible values among the ones generated in the previous step

    3. Comparison

        The program PF is executed on each possible combinations of its selected input values. If, at some point, the values produced are in the set of the possible output values generated in step 1, then it is a success.

### Evaluation

*TEA*

When detecting TEA, they found that there was some alternative of TEA in malware. They confirmed this observation by creating a **reference implementation** (parameter) for the Russian-TEA function. Aligot then successfully identified the code in Storm Worm as a Russian-TEA implementation, as indicated in Table 2.

*RC4* 

*AES*

*MD5*

*RSA* 

This creates an outer loop pat- tern that is not directly detectable with Aligot because the trace generated does not belong to the LOOP language of Definition 2.

Aligot was able to detect RSA with some precautious.

### Limitation

Aligot is only able to identify the code that is actually executed at the run time.

It is also limited to the functions in which they process a reference implementation.
